I am a psychometric researcher at Cito in Arnhem, Netherlands, and was awarded the Master's in Methodology and Statistics for the Behavioural, Biomedical and Social Sciences with Cum Laude by Utrecht University in 2025. My main areas of interest are educational measurement, survey design, and promoting reproducibility in research. I'm also into music; you can learn about everything I play on my [sister website](https://www.adam-maghout.co.uk/){target="_blank"}.
