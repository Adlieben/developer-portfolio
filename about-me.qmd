I'm a graduate student and research assistant at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. My main areas of interest are educational measurement, survey design, and promoting reproducibility in research. I really enjoy teaching, and have been teaching French online for over three years, as well as teaching on summer courses. I'm also into music, you can learn about everything I play on my [sister website](https://www.adam-maghout.co.uk/){target="_blank"}.
